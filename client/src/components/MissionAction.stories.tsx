The MissionAction component is where team members secretly decide the fate of missions. This is the core mechanic that determines the outcome of each round.

### Mission Rules

- **Good Players** - Can only choose SUCCESS ✓
- **Evil Players** - Can choose SUCCESS ✓ or FAIL ✗
- **Secret Ballots** - Choices are shuffled before reveal
- **Fail Threshold** - Usually 1 fail = mission failure (2 required on 4th mission with 7+ players)

### Component States

1. **Active Voting** - Shows success/fail buttons for team members
2. **Waiting** - Non-team members see waiting message
3. **Already Voted** - Confirmation after submitting your choice

### Strategic Depth

Mission voting creates complex decisions:
- Evil players must decide when to fail missions
- Failing too early reveals your identity
- Failing too late may lose the game
- Good players have no choice but provide cover for evil
- The number of fails can reveal team composition
