The MissionSummaryTable provides a comprehensive overview of game history, showing all missions, proposals, votes, and outcomes in a structured table format. This is essential for analyzing gameplay patterns and making informed decisions.

### Table Structure

**Columns:**
- **Mission Number** - Shows mission 1-5 with team size requirements
- **Player Rows** - One row per player showing their participation
- **Proposal Tracking** - Numbered proposals with vote outcomes
- **Mission Results** - Success/Fail indicators with fail counts

### Visual Indicators

- **âœ“** - Player approved the proposal
- **âœ—** - Player rejected the proposal
- **ðŸ‘‘** - Player was the proposer
- **Color Coding** - Green for success, red for failure
- **Team Highlights** - Selected team members are highlighted
- **Role Display** - Shows roles when game is complete

### Information Analysis

The table helps players:
- Track voting patterns to identify alliances
- See who proposed which teams
- Analyze mission participation and outcomes
- Review the complete game history at a glance
- Understand why certain decisions were made

### Post-Game Analysis

When roles are revealed, the table becomes a powerful tool for understanding the game dynamics and learning from player behaviors.
